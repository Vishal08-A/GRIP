A Task in Data Science & Business Analytics Internship assigned by The Spark Foundation in its Graduate Rotation Internship program #GRIPJUNE2024

Task Name :- Prediction Using Supervised ML

Description :- The objective of the task is Predict the percentage of student based on the numbers of study hours by using supervised machine learning.

The project "Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning" aims to develop a model that predicts the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. Using supervised ML techniques, the model is trained on a dataset that contains the number of study hours and corresponding student percentages. By analyzing and recognizing patterns within the data, the model becomes capable of accurately estimating a student's percentage when provided with the number of hours they studied. This project is immensely useful in educational institutions, as it helps educators and administrators gauge student performance and identify areas where additional support may be required.
